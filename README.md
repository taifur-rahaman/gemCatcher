# Gem Catcher

A Game using Godot 4.5.1 Engine. A simple 2D arcade Game where the player moves a paddle horizontally to catch falling gems.

Features
1. Gem Spawning
   - Gems are instantiated at a fixed height above the viewable screen.
   - The X position is randomized within the screen margins to ensure gems stay visible.

2. Dynamic Falling Mechanics
   - Each gem is assigned a random falling speed (`falling_rate`) between 40 and 200 upon creation.
   - Gems are destroyed automatically if they leave the bottom of the screen.

3. Player Movement
   - The paddle is controlled via keyboard input.
   - Movement is clamped to the screen edges so the paddle cannot leave the viewport.

4. Scoring and Game Over
   - Catching a gem triggers a console message: "+1 Point".
   - Letting a gem fall past the screen triggers a console message: "Game Over".

Notes
- This project relies on Godot's Scene system. The scripts must be attached to their respective nodes (`Node2D` for Game, `Area2D` for Paddle/Gems).
- To play, ensure your Project Settings > Input Map has actions defined for `move_left` and `move_right`.
- Scoring and Game Over states currently print to the Output console (Debug).
